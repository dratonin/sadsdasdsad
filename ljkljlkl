# SECURITY FIX: Removed hardcoded OpenAI API key
# 
# WARNING: This key may be compromised and must be rotated immediately.
# Never commit actual secrets to version control. Add .env to .gitignore.
# 
# Configuration:
# 1. Replace placeholder with your actual API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. For production, use a secrets manager instead of environment variables
# 
# Example: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_key_here

OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
